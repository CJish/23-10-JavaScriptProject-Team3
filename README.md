This is a project I worked on with the awesome Lance Evans and Aranka Bullen in late 2023.

I focused on integrating Strava's API to populate charts on a web page in real time; all of my work can be found in the "sleep_page" and "workout_page" directories.

It's not perfect: if I'd had more time, my next steps would have been to integrate something like OAuth2.0 instead of the current authorization that it's using. Still, coming from zero HTML/CSS/Javascript experience to successfully integrating the three technologies to produce an attractive chart using an API in 3 weeks shows pretty good development.
